(This is Work in progress!!! Stay tuned...)

 ----

The table of contents is in TABLE_OF_CONTENTS
Have a look at the config file first before trying it. The files contain
descriptions.

 ----

Try the tutorial configs from one directory up (the one "rabak" is in).

To look at a tutorial's config file:
./rabak -c tutorial/rabak.tutorial01.cf conf

You will see what backup sets are available (e.g. "tutorial" or "tutorial04")

 ----

To look at a backup set's config:
./rabak -c tutorial/rabak.tutorial01.cf conf <backup set>

 ----

To try a backup:
./rabak -c tutorial/rabak.tutorial01.cf backup <backup set>

PLEASE NOTE: Some of the tutorial files will stop with an Error. This is
ok, as they demonstrate features e.g. mounting devices. The tutorials
are meant to be examples, not out-of-the-box solutions.

Change the 01 in the file name to 02, 03, ..
