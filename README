Welcome! This is Rabak, a backup tool


Requirements
============
You need Linux or Cygwin.
Other plattforms may work too. I didn't try.

You need rsync. I know rabak does't work before version 2.6.4.
Maybe even a newer one is requires. The newer the better.

You need Perl, I don't know which version. Probably >= 5.8

You need the Mail::Send perl module. Fetch it from CPAN:
cpan -i Mail::Send

To use faster-dupemerge, you will need this the Perl module
Digest::SHA1. To install it do this:
cpan -i Digest::SHA1


Installation
============
Make a directory /usr/local/rabak and copy the contents of this
directory there.


Quick Start
===========
Change to the installation directory:
cd /usr/local/rabak

Look at the documentation:
perldoc RabakLib::Doc

Make a test backup:
./rabak -c rabak.cf.dist backup test

Have a look at the result:
ls -lA test-bak

Read the documentation:
perldoc RabakLib::Doc

Configure Rabak:
nano -w rabak.cf

The 'cd' is a bit awkward, I know. I'll find a trick to let
Rabak find it's libraries later.


Feature Tests
=============
You can test more features by doing:

cd stuff
sh testdev-make
cd ..
./rabak -c rabak.cf.dist backup test1
./rabak -c rabak.cf.dist -i Tue backup test2
./rabak -c rabak.cf.dist -i Tue2 backup test2

TODO: be more verbose


Developers
==========
You can extend Rabak and add backup types. Have a look into
the RabakLib/Type directory.


Have fun!
