Welcome! This is Rabak, a backup tool

GIT TEST

Requirements
============
You need Linux or Cygwin. Other plattforms may work too. We didn't try.

You need rsync. I know rabak does't work before version 2.6.4.
Maybe even a newer one is requires. The newer the better.

You need Perl, I don't know which version. Probably >= 5.8

You need the Mail::Send and IPC::Run perl module. Fetch it from CPAN:
cpan -i Mail::Send
cpan -i IPC::Run

To use faster-dupemerge, you will need the Perl module Digest::SHA1.
To install it do:
cpan -i Digest::SHA1


Installation
============
Make a directory /usr/local/rabak and copy the contents of this
directory there.


Quick Start
===========
Change to the installation directory:
cd /usr/local/rabak

Look at the documentation:
./rabak doc

Make a test backup:
./rabak -c rabak.sample.cf backup test

Have a look at the result:
ls -lA test-bak

Read the documentation:
perldoc RabakLib::Doc

Configure Rabak:
cp rabak.sample.cf rabak.cf
nano -w rabak.cf

The 'cd' is a bit awkward, I know. I'll find a trick to let
Rabak find it's libraries later.


Feature Tests
=============
If you have the right to run mount and mknod, you can test more
features by doing:

cd stuff; sh testdev-make; cd ..

This produces a test environment in test-data. Data will be
backed up into test-bak. You can run the sample configurations
provided in rabak.sample.cf:

./rabak -c rabak.sample.cf backup test_firstof
./rabak -c rabak.sample.cf -i Tue backup test_targetgroup
./rabak -c rabak.sample.cf -i Tue2 backup test_targetgroup

When you're done, you can remove the test environment:

cd stuff; sh testdev-remove; cd ..

Check out the docs and the *.cf files for more insight.


Further reading
===============

Documentation is available through rabak itself:
./rabak doc

The most recent version and complete docs are available at:
http://www.raisin.de/rabak


Developers
==========
You can extend Rabak and add backup types. Have a look into
the RabakLib/Type directory.


Have fun!
