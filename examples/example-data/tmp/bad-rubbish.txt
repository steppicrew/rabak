Creationalism is a mystery.
Full of creation that no one sees.
Evolution is a stupid made-up theory.
And Charles Darwin is a meane.
I don't believe in Evolution.
[If evolution is "true," how come there hasn't been any changes in animals recently! HA HA!, evolutionist!!!]
I believe in the one true God.
I don't care if you ca-complain.
Because I just KNOW that you are wron-on! [(wrong)]

Evolution is stupid. "The idea that we descended from apes is ridiculous"
