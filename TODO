As you see this is a early version, and there's things missing:

- Documentation is not complete
--- Explain faster-dupemerge
- More backup types
- Proper exit codes
- Make ACLs work
- No passwords into rabak.cf
- Various TODOs in the library.
- Explain wrapper
- implement post processing with faster-dupemerge
